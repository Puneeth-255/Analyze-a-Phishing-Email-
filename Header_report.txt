- DMARC: ✅ Compliant
  (Domain policy is properly enforced, helps in preventing spoofing.)
- SPF Alignment: ❌ Failed
  (Sender used unauthorized mail server.)
- SPF Authenticated:❌ Failed
- DKIM Alignment: ✅ Passed
- DKIM Authenticated: ❌ Failed
  (The message's DKIM signature could not be verified. This might indicate tampering or a misconfiguration.)

Relay & Server Path:

Received Delay: 1.06 second (Normal)

Mail Hops:

1. From: NzE3NzNyMk | Server: geopid-ismtpd-28 | Status: OK
2. From: Unknown     | Server: recvd-586fc64576-dz729 | Status: OK
3. From: o1.ptr2949.theforage.com (IP: 192.73.455.34) | Status: ⚠️ Blacklisted
4. To: mx.google.com via 2002:a05:7208:4047:b0:a2:afec:4997 | Status: OK

Observations:

- DKIM failure indicates potential message tampering or configuration error.
- One server in the path (192.73.455.34) is on a blacklist — this raises a red flag.
- SPF and DMARC are both failed.
- outcome - the email is partially suspicious and should be treated with caution.

Conclusion:

the SPF, DKIM failure and presence of a blacklisted server IP make this email ""potentially suspicious" .
